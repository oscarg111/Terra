PREPHASE: Recover old code and restore (if needed)

PHASE 1:

Create a database of products with barcodes and other necessary information to avoid searching repeated products
Create a system to sort out the result into [trash/recycling/(compost)]
Formulate an idea to speed up searching process (not vital to the system for P1)
Create system to make the ‘education’ of the user more prevalent in the system

PHASE 2:

Create Barcode image recognition
Using camera or Barcode Scanner
Database made of barcode images that correspond with the database in P1
Attempt to create an E-waste functionality
With places to recycle
And incentive details
Similar to Earth911 API search

PHASE 3:

Create image recognition
Using Camera
Use an API (google/microsoft)
Create faster loading speeds (again, not vital to the system)
Save images to a database as well as barcode details
Can be used to avoid loading times

PHASE 4:

AI like system
Usage of the databases from P1/P2/P3 to aid in a hassle free search system
